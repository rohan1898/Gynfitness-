			Why follow a 7 day split workout routine?
		</h3>
		<br>
		<div>
			If you were to talk to the average Joe, who happens to have a limited pool of knowledge regarding health and fitness, if you were to tell them that you were training 7 days per week, they would gasp in horror and tell you that you are overtraining and that you should stop immediately, before the entire world ends!
			<br>
			Ok, that last part was pretty dramatic, but they would tell you to stop immediately and would talk about the importance of rest and recovery. Rest and recovery are indeed both vital components of any training regime, but, providing you are getting enough good quality sleep each night, if you were to follow a 7 day split for a limited amount of time, you would see some pretty fantastic results.
			<br>
			By training 7 days a week, your body doesn’t know whether it is coming or going, and so it will begin to overcompensate by generating more energy by burning more calories, which means you not only have more energy, you also burn more fat as well.
			<br>
			It is also a great way of shocking the muscles into new growth as it really helps to stimulate muscle hypertrophy, which is exactly what you want when it comes to making new gains.

				DAY 6 and 7
			</h3>
			<br>
			<div>
				Here is where things get interesting, because in reality, there is no right or wrong exercise or muscle group for you to train on days 6 and 7, which is one of the reasons why these types of splits are considered so fun and so enjoyable.<br>

				Basically, when you follow a 7 day split, you use your two additional training days, to bring up lagging body parts and muscle groups, or to help you reach your goals much quicker. So, if for example, you feel that your chest is lagging in comparison to the rest of your body, you would train your chest on day 6 perhaps, repeating the same chest workout from day 1.<br>

				Remember however, you will be training chest again on day 1, so never train chest on day 7, as it will still need additional time to recover.<br>

				Some people choose to use their additional training days, to train lagging body parts on day 6, and will then use day 7 to perform cardio to help them burn calories and to help them get their body fat percentages under control.<br>
				<br>
				So, as an example, their training schedule, may look something like:
				<i><h2>
					Day 6 – Repeat chest workout from day 1
				</h2>
				<h2>
					Day 7 – 60 minutes of steady state cardio.
				</h2>	</i>
			</div><u>
			<h1>
				Put simply: use your additional training days to help you make improvements where you feel they are needed the most.<br>
				If your strength is lacking, lower the reps and increase the weights that you use, if your back is lacking, blitz your back again, and so on…
